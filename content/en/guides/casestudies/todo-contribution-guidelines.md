# Open Source Program Office Case Study Guidelines

The TODO OSPO Case Study initiative features real-world use cases and the impact OSPO Programs and open source are having on an organization.
OSPO Use Cases build narratives around open source organization’s journey that includes Open Source Program Office highlighted activities, organizational structure,
best practices, goals, and success stories, showcasing participating organizations as leaders in the OSPO field.

## Requirements

**Who can be featured in an OSPO Case Study?**

As a rule, OSPO case studies feature:

* Private and public organizations running an OSPO or an open source initiative
* TODO members

All case studies must demonstrate at least one tangible business impact of OSPOs within the
organization and/or open source ecosystem. Examples from published case studies include the
work done at OSPOs in terms of:

* Compliance, legal, and developer education
* Evangelizing Open Source Culture and Usage
* Hosting Open Source Projects
* Growing Open Source Communities
* Improving leadership and becoming a decision-making partner
* OSPO Best practices (e.g tooling, documentation, etc)

## OSPO Case Study Process
OSPO case studies follow a self-service model with editorial support and guidance provided by TODO Group and LF.

The self-service follows a five-step process:

**1. Proposal**

Organizations submit a case study proposal

**2. Review**
* TODO steering committee team reviews proposal within 30 working days
* If the proposal meets the criteria, the TODO PM sends a case study pack to the contact info provided
* If the proposal doesn’t meet the criteria, TODO Program Manager will provide feedback and the organization is invited to resubmit.

**3. Creation**

Primary contact writes a case study following the required style documented in the case study pack

**4. Editing**
* TODO Group reviews the case study and makes any necessary edits as suggestions
* Edits are based on the style guide.
* Primary contact is welcome to make further edits or additions to the case study
* Primary contact confirms when the draft is final and manages any approval processes

**5. Publishing**
* TODO and LF prepare the case study for publication
* Primary Contact will receive a preview link, to view the case study before it goes live.
* Case Study is published to todogroup.org and OSPO guide
* Promotion cycle begins

**6. Promotion**
* Case studies are published on todogorup.org. TODO Group and LF market the case studies online, through social media, blog promotion, and the TODO OSPO newsletter.
