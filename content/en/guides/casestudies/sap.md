# SAP: One of Open Source’s Best Kept Secrets

SAP’s open source program office (OSPO) is relatively new.  The German software giant formally started its OSPO in April of this year, but it’s been working with open source for decades. "SAP was one of the first industry players to formally define an open source consumption process and approval process for building products," said Peter Giese, Director of SAP Open Source Program Office.

Even so, the myth that SAP is closed and proprietary persists to this day. It’s a myth that sprung from a past of quiet and studied focus on open source pursuits. 

> "In past years, maybe we have not been so transparent or as active in sharing what SAP is doing with respect to open source," says Giese. “Early on, we had about 10 different teams at SAP spread over different board areas that took care of certain aspects of open source. For instance, for the security scanning, for the license scanning, for building your own open source tool.”

The company is shining a spotlight on their work in open source now. Transparency is their new open source mandate. It begins by explaining what they’ve been up to and where they are headed with open source. 

## How SAP came to adopt open source

> "In 1998, SAP started to port our R/3 system, that was our market leading ERP system, to Linux," said Giese. “That was the year when Google was founded, just to give you some perspective.”

Porting a system to Linux was just a first step, and a successful one. The action spurred an internal discussion and exploration of how and where to adopt Linux going forward. 

> "We came to the conclusion that Linux would become a major force," said Giese. “Today that's obvious, at the time it was maybe not as obvious for everybody. That's where we started our endeavors into open source.”

In 2001, SAP formally defined and internally documented the process for how it would handle open source consumption. In other words, the company committed to using inbound open source projects to build SAP products. There were lots of details to attend to, such as open source licensing, security protocols, and export control restrictions.

By 2004, SAP already had information on the specs exchange with other companies and was one of the founding members of the Eclipse Foundation. SAP developers were actively contributing to Eclipse and Linux. 

However, it wasn’t until 2008 that SAP started actively promoting open source contributions from SAP employees. That was also the year that the company rolled out its outbound open source process. "We had a set of guidelines and rules for what SAP teams have to do in order to outsource their work and share it to the open source community," explained Giese.

In 2010, SAP integrated open source tools further into its business processes. "We moved to a higher level of compliance by introducing systematic open source code scannings as part of our standard development process," said Giese. “That means we started to use tools to systematically scan open source code for license issues or license compliance, and for security issues and security vulnerabilities and so on.”

One example is a tool SAP called [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io) that the company used for managing computer license agreements. There were other teams working on IP questions and other issues too at the time. Work with open source was distributed throughout the enterprise.

> "There was not a board member or one board area which took the overall responsibility for everything open source at SAP," said Giese. “That has changed now. Bjoern Goerke is the CTO of SAP, and he is now the one completely responsible for all things open source with SAP.”

## SAP and open source today

The Office of CTO at SAP formally created the SAP open source program office under Goerke’s direction. While OSPOs are common in companies across many industries, there was more at stake for SAP than joining in on a broader movement of best practices.

> "We wanted to coordinate all this internal work, as well as be more active and more visible in our interactions with our outside partners, open source foundations, and with open source communities," said Giese. “That's why we joined the TODO Group last year.”

Giese says the company’s open source efforts are substantial, yet they are still a surprise to many people in open source communities.

> "For example, someone who works with Adobe posted his own statistics on GitHub in February on open source contributions," said Giese. “If I remember correctly, SAP placed number seven worldwide. There are, of course, different ways to create such statistics, but at least this gives you some indication that SAP is a heavy contributor. We’re one of open source’s best kept secrets.”

SAP had rather not be a secret any longer and is stepping up its open source game in more visible ways.

> "We want to join more of the non-SAP conferences, open source conferences, like Open Source Summit or OSCON. Also, technical conferences like KubeCon," he says. “We want to engage more with other foundations, with members of the TODO group, and with other companies to jointly work together on bringing open source processes forward.”

SAP’s climb to higher visibility is a sign of its continued commitment to excellence in open source, wherein the company aims to form more partnerships and spur accelerated development in innovations. 

One example of SAP’s latest, strategic and innovative open source projects is the [Gardener project](https://gardener.cloud/), which positions Kubernetes as a service, in the context of Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It enables management of a large number of Kubernetes clusters and the reuse of Kubernetes primitives in its core architecture.

SAP is actively encouraging companies and other developers to cooperate and co-develop on projects like Gardener. But extending invitations to others to co-innovate is not new at SAP. 

> "This aspect of co-innovation is for me the most compelling thing about the whole open source movement. It’s also an idea that SAP always had," said Giese.

 > "From its first day in 1972, SAP has delivered its business application to customers in the form of source code," he added. “That was not open source in the sense that we are discussing today, but the source was open in the sense that the customer could see it and could even modify it or could add code to that. That's what SAP calls custom development.”

## SAP’s OSPO configuration and how it works

 SAP formed a virtual team consisting of nine different teams from different board areas. 

> "We are working in scrum mode, which is a software development methodology. It has advantages in driving an open source program office," says Michael Picht, Chief Development Architect in SAP’s OSPO. “You work in sprints in scrum, and this means you're forced to break down your tasks in smaller pieces.”

> "The scrum methodology propagates cross-functional teams, and that’s what our OSPO is - We have people from our legal department in there, licensing experts, people that take care of open source security etc. Scrum facilitates the work in such a setup. It sounds strange to some people when they hear we work in scrum mode, but in our case, it is working quite well."

Picht says that breaking big jobs down into smaller tasks and working in four-week sprints helps make challenging and even intimidating jobs easier to master. It does require some training, however, to make sure all team members are comfortable with the method.

> "For departments that are not from the development side, like legal or IP, of course they weren't really very familiar with agile development and scrum methodologies, so we had to give them a short introduction," Giese explained. It was also a bit of an experiment, but so far it turns out to be relatively successful, at least more successful than our previous approaches.”

As for employees that want to work on open source projects outside of the company, SAP has reduced the clearance process dramatically. "We have defined a few rules, and we say adhere to that without any further proof, and you can directly start in your spare time to work on open source projects as well," says Giese. 

The company is also working on a new version of its outbound open source process to make it more efficient and less complex. The goal is to shift from policing developers to enabling them through shorter forms, helpful automation, and support team services.

SAP’s OSPO is continually looking for ways to speed and improve processes, and to support developers, partners, and open source communities.

> "This will never end, this will always go on, so we always want to find out where we can improve our processes further," said Picht.
