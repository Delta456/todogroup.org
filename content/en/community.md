TODO resources are open to everyone and available at TODO Group GitHub repo under CC-BY 4.0 Licence. You can see all the TODO Community resources in the [TODO GH README ORG](https://github.com/todogroup#-discover-the-todo-resources-and-initiatives)

## OSPOlogy

If you‚Äôre new to TODO Group, or to OSPOs, we encourage you to join one of our upcoming OSPOlogy sessions. 

These virtual, monthly calls focus on open source program best practices, and allow community members to learn from each other. Joining a call is a great way to meet other community members, or learn about initiatives you may want to participate in. You can join an [upcoming session](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group/) to ask the experts questions, or even sign up to teach one!

We also have regular [OSPOlogy discussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions). Browse the current topics, or open a new one. Make sure to join us on Slack so that you can get the most out of it. 

Remember to check out our [OSPO guides](https://todogroup.org/guides/) for more help getting your OSPO started or implementing best practices. If you have ideas for how we can better support you, [open a discussion](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions). We look forward to hearing from you! 

## TODO Discussions

To discuss issues with the TODO Group you're welcome to open a new discussion at [OSPOlogy discussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions).

You can also reach out to [info@todogroup.org](mailto:info@todogroup.org) with any questions.


## TODO General Member Resources

The [members of this group](/members) at times share sensitive information and use a private mailing list for that type of discussion. Information shared in this channel is later anonymized and shared to the wider OSPO community via [OSPO Discussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions).

# üåè TODO Chapters

**TODO EU Chapter**

The TODO EU chapter was formed by TODO Members based in Europe. This chapter was created with the aim of working together to improve OSPO adoption and education within Europe and discuss with the broader community the challenges European organizations face when implementing an open source program.

TODO EU Chapter Members organize public monthly sync meetings open to everyone. If you would like to participate, you can join the EMEA monthly Sync meetings [here](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group-europe/)
