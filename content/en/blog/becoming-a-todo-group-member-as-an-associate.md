Open source program offices have become a best practice for companies that rely on open source technologies. As open source program offices have spread, there has been increased interest in applying this best practice in non-corporate contexts. Cities, universities, and other non-corporate organizations are starting to see the benefits of creating a center of competency for open source.

The TODO Group is a Linux Foundation collaborative project that serves as a working group for open source program office members around the world. In order to join the TODO Group, an organization needs to also be a member of the Linux Foundation. Many of the members of the Linux Foundations are companies or corporations who pay annual membership fees and also are paying members of one of the many sub-foundations hosted by the LF. But what do you do if you represent a muncipality or academic institution who is interested in forming an open source programs office? 

Fortuntely, the Linux Foundation also offers an Associate Membership for civic, academic, and non-profit institutions who wish to join the LF and the TODO Group. Joining as an Associate Member is a simple, free process that opens up access to the TODO Group for any qualifying institution.

You can view the Associate Membership application in the TODO Group's [Governance](https://github.com/todogroup/governance) repository, which also contains the TODO Charter and Membership Agreement. If you wish to join as an Associate Member, please email info@todogroup.org for more information.
